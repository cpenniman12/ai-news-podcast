# Enhanced AI News Podcast Generator

## New Features ‚ú®

Your AI News Podcast app now includes **enhanced research capabilities** that go far beyond simple headline-based scripts!

## How It Works üîç

When you select headlines and generate a podcast, here's what happens behind the scenes:

### 1. **Deep Research Phase** (20-30 seconds)
- For each selected headline, the system searches multiple web sources using the Brave Search API
- Extracts key information: funding amounts, technical details, company names, dates
- Focuses on AI-specific terms like OpenAI, Anthropic, ChatGPT, Claude, Nvidia, etc.
- Gathers 5-8 detailed sources per story

### 2. **AI Script Generation** (GPT-4o)
- Combines headline + research data into detailed prompts
- Creates 2-3 minute conversational segments per story  
- Includes specific numbers, implications, and context
- Generates smooth transitions between stories
- Professional podcast-style introduction and conclusion

### 3. **High-Quality Audio** (OpenAI TTS)
- Converts the enhanced script to natural-sounding audio
- Uses the "alloy" voice for consistent, professional sound
- Optimizes script length for TTS limits

## Example Workflow üìù

**Input Headlines:**
- "Telegram & xAI Announce $300M Grok AI Deal - WinBuzzer (Wed May 28 2025)"
- "OpenAI GPT-5 Release Timeline Update (Thu May 29 2025)"

**Research Results:**
- Finds details about the $300M investment structure
- Discovers revenue split arrangements (50% to Telegram)
- Locates technical specifications and user impact
- Gathers competitive context and market implications

**Generated Script Sample:**
```
