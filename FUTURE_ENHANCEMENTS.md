# Future Enhancements

## 1. Script Writer Search Access
Give the script writer LLM access to the news search tool to prevent hallucination. Currently, only headlines are passed (10-20 words), forcing the script writer to generate 300-450 word segments from outdated training data.

## 2. User Story History
Allow Claude to query past stories the user has selected. This enables personalization and prevents duplicate coverage of topics the user has already consumed.

## 3. Skip Pre-Generated Stories
Let users skip stories that already have audio generated. This could streamline the flow by going directly from fresh headlines to audio generation, potentially eliminating the headline curation step for stories with existing audio.
