# App Icons Needed

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add two app icon files to the `public` folder:

1. `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

## Quick Options:

### Option 1: Use an online tool
- Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Upload a logo or image
- Download the generated icons

### Option 2: Use Canva or Figma
- Create a 512x512 square design
- Export as PNG
- Use an online tool to resize to 192x192

### Option 3: Simple solid color placeholder
You can use any image editing tool to create simple colored squares with "AI" text for testing.

## Important:
The app will work without icons, but iOS won't show a nice icon when you "Add to Home Screen" until these are added.
